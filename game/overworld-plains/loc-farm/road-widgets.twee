	You stand at the road and wait for a car to arrive. Soon, you hear noises in the far distance. You wave your arms once you spot a car driving up the road towards you, trying to catch the driver's attention.
	<br><br>
	You see the car's brake lights glow and take a few steps closer to the street. The car slows down at first, only to suddenly accelerate its speed again and drives through a puddle right in front of you.
