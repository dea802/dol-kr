You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
<<set _rng to random(1, 5)>>
<<switch _rng>>
	<<case 1>>
		You rub <<childname>> gently with the warm water, making sure to clean between the folds of skin, and holding <<childhis>> little body with one hand. The softness of <<childhis>> skin as you rub makes you feel extremely at ease. The baby seems to be tickled by your touches, and swings <<childhis>> legs in the water, making some of it splash on your clothes and face. You can't help but smile at the situation.<<ltrauma>><<trauma -6>>
	<<case 2>>
		You gently rub <<childname>>'s head in circular motions with a handful of baby shampoo. The sweet aroma of strawberry fills the ambient, and bubbles begin to appear in the water. Your child seems curious, and periodically takes one of <<childhis>> fingers to the bubbles, popping them. <<childHis>> mellow laughter echoes through the room as <<childhe>> is distracted by the foam in the bathtub.<<ltrauma>><<lstress>><<trauma -6>><<stress -6>>
	<<case 3>>
		You start the bath by trying to soap your baby's body. <<childHe>> doesn't seem to like the feel of water on <<childhis>> skin, let alone seems to be enjoying your attempts to cleanse <<childhim>>. <<childname>> threatens to cry as you continue the bath, but you manage to calm <<childhim>> down after a little effort. <<childHe>> pouts in distaste until the end of the cleaning session. When you're finished, <<childhe>> doesn't seem to want to let you carry <<childhim>> back, and makes uncontent sounds when you pick <<childhim>> up.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<default>>
		Just by touching the water, <<childname>> lets out a high-pitched, incessant cry. <<childHe>> flails <<childhis>> legs and arms into the water trying to get free as you struggle to rub <<childhim>> properly. Water splashes quickly soak your clothes. <<childHe>> continues throwing a tantrum until the end of the bath, leaving you with a headache.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
<</switch>>
<br><br>

When you're done bathing <<childHim>>, you lay <<childHim>> on a towel and gently dry <<childHis>> body with a softer fabric. You carefully finish the moment by changing the baby's nappies and putting <<childHim>> back in <<childHis>> crib.
