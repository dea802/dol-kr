	그들은 찍은 사진들을 비교한다. 그 중 둘이 당신의 눈 앞에 핸드폰 화면을 들이민다.

	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 손가락으로 브이 자를 그리며 웃고 있다. 모르고 봤다면 협박 당해 찍힌 사진이라는 것을 모를 수도 있을 것 같다.
	<<elseif $mathsab1 is "frown">>
	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 눈살을 찌푸린 채로, 손으로 카메라를 향해 욕을 하고 있다.
	<<elseif $mathsab1 is "cover">>
	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 얼굴을 가리고 있다. 이것만 봐서는 사진 속 인물이 당신이라는 것을 알 순 없을 것 같다.
	<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearsmile">>
	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 손가락으로 브이 자를 그리며 웃고 있다. 얼굴이 눈물로 젖어있고, 미소도 억지로 짓는 티가 난다.
	<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearfrown">>
	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 눈살을 찌푸린 채로, 화가 나서 눈물을 흘리고 있다. 또한 손으로 카메라를 향해 욕을 하고 있다.
	<<elseif $mathsab1 is "tearcover">>
	첫 번째 사진에서 당신은 얼굴을 가리고 있다. 손 밑으로 눈물이 흐르고 있다.
	<</if>>
	시간 간격을 두고 찍힌 두 번째 사진에서 당신은 보다 흐트러진 모습이다. 무언가 매끄럽고 번들거리는 것에 뒤덮여 있다.
	<<if $mathsab2 is "smile">>
	미소를 짓고 있긴 하나, 눈초리가 뭔가 이상하다.
	<<elseif $mathsab2 is "frown">>
	당신은 화가 나, 반항적인 표정을 하고 있다.
	<<elseif $mathsab2 is "cover">>
	당신은 얼굴을 가리고 있다.
	<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearsmile">>
	미소를 짓고 있긴 하나, 당시 상황에 눈물이 흐르고 있는 것이 보인다.
	<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearfrown">>
	얼굴은 눈물 투성이이나, 화가 나서 반항적인 표정을 하고 있다.
	<<elseif $mathsab2 is "tearcover">>
	당신은 얼굴을 가리고 있으나, 분명히 눈물이 흘러내리고 있다.

			"The romantic play turns out to have been an excuse for the two main characters to make out on stage. Doren has to split them apart and force them to continue their lines.",
			"The play is about vampires, with the students being in heavy make-up for it. You're sure you'll spot some of them in the restrooms later, trying to wash it all off.",
			"The play finished quickly, with the lead <<actor>> having gotten sick.",
			"The play gets ended early by Doren, due to the <<actor>> <<actorAroused>>",
			"The play is based on some children's story, but due to its grim nature you assume it's the original German version of it.",
			"The actors forgot most of their lines during this play and decided to improvise. Once they start exclusively cracking jokes and breaking character, Doren steps in and makes them read from the script.",
			"The lead <<actor>> does a wonderful job during the play, being very happy to show off <<his>> homemade costume. It's very clear that Doren did not approve said costume beforehand.",
			"As an unexpected twist, the lead <<actor>> strips during the final act. Doren doesn't get a chance to intervene, as the play is already over.",
			"The play follows the story of a great battle, with the actors wearing makeshift medieval armour.",
			"The actors act in a short play about a housewife who, having been disillusioned with her husband, leaves him to seek more out of life.",
			"During the play, one of the actors' costumes rips, flashing everyone in the room. Doren quickly throws a blanket onto <<him>> and hurries <<him>> backstage.",
			"The play draws out, as one of the students decides to go on a monologue much longer than what was written in the script.",
			"During the play, one of the students screams out after another <<actor>> touches <<him>>, forcing Doren to end the play early and send the other student home.",
			"In the midsts of the play, an <<actor>> has an issue with <<his>> wardrobe, causing <<his>> clothing to slip down and flash the entire audience.",
			"Halfway through the play, one of the students in the background sees <<his>> chance and pulls down <<his>> pants. Doren tackles <<him>>, and the rest of the play somehow finishes as planned.",
			"The play portrays the struggle of a family during the 1920s, the actors dressed in dirty clothing and rags.",
			"The play ends up being a dark comedy about a dysfunctional family gathering together for the holidays.",
			"The students act in a political satire about a mayor being caught in a sex scandal. It draws special interest from a few members of the audience.",
			"The students, while trying to act serious during a comedy routine, struggle not to break character. However, the performance is received well.",
			"A romantic comedy turns overly sexual as two students hide under the blankets for a scene. They're very obviously having public coitus.",
			"The play seems to be going fine until the lead <<actor>> pulls <<his>> pants down in the middle of a soliloquy. Doren covers <<him>> with a blanket, escorting <<him>> off of the stage."
